This means keeping your color palette restrained and in line with design principles. Sticking to black and white in your logo design adds a premium feel, while a pop of color can make your logo and brand design feel more approachable.</p></div></div>

A logo that doesn’t look good in one of these mediums can hurt your reputation as a designer. Opt for a clean logo layout that will look just as good on screens as it does in print, to boost trust in your graphic design skills.</p></div></div>

<div class="alt-layout__content"><h3>Typography</h3><p>While most graphic designers favor images over words, your logo still needs a great font. Like your colors, your fonts should demonstrate an understanding of design principles. You can’t go wrong with a bold, minimalist font or a simple, custom font. Whatever font you choose, make sure it’s legible across sizes and mediums, while still standing out from the competition. </p></div></div>

<div class="alt-layout__content"><h3>Symbol</h3><p>If you want to add a symbol to your logo, make sure it suits your particular graphic design business. Your symbol should add meaning to your logo—not clutter. Once you’ve found a symbol that suits your brand and offering, make sure it matches your other logo design elements and can scale well with them across a variety of sizes and mediums. </p></div></div><div class="alt-layout__section alt-layout__section--half alt-layout__section--narrow"><img width="612" height="686" src="https://cdn.logojoy.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824150436/logo-ideas-page-1.png" class="lozad lozad" alt="Lightbulb against dark background - logo ideas special features" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.logojoy.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824150436/logo-ideas-page-1.png 612w, https://cdn.logojoy.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824150436/logo-ideas-page-1-535x600.png 535w, https://cdn.logojoy.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824150436/logo-ideas-page-1-312x350.png 312w" sizes="(minwidth 1000px) 50vw, 75vw" data-src="https://cdn.logojoy.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824150436/logo-ideas-page-1.png" data-srcset="https://cdn.logojoy.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824150436/logo-ideas-page-1.png 612w, https://cdn.logojoy.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824150436/logo-ideas-page-1-535x600.png 535w, https://cdn.logojoy.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824150436/logo-ideas-page-1-312x350.png 312w" data-loaded="true">
