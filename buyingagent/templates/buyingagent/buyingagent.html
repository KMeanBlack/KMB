            We actively work on improving quality assurance by applying modern work methods, encouraging factories to upgrade machinery, and not least, ensuring that proper processes are in place.
         
            We divide the quality process into two phases - 

            The first phase refers to the pre-production process where the quality controllers take part in evaluating samples and fits, etc.
            
            The second phase is hands-on quality monitoring on the production floors. This includes, but is not limited to, initial, inline, and midline inspections. Final inspection is conducted when all goods are packed and in accordance with A.Q.L 2.5 or any other guidelines provided by our customers.
            ​
            
            We frequently collaborate with external third-party entities to safeguard that our judgment is on par with  market expectations, or when a customer wishes to use an external party. Inspection reports are always shared upon the request of customers.
            
            All garments are tested for the basic parameters at our in-house laboratory at pre-production sample stage as an additional checkpoint to third party labs/ test reports.
